## Overview

The 91st Iowa General Assembly consists of **`r nrow(people)`** legislators serving in the House and Senate.

```{r}
# Party breakdown by chamber
chamber_party <- people |>
  count(role, party) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = party, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) |>
  mutate(
    Chamber = case_when(
      role == "Rep" ~ "House",
      role == "Sen" ~ "Senate"
    )
  ) |>
  select(Chamber, R, D) |>
  mutate(Total = R + D)

gt(chamber_party) |>
  cols_label(
    R = "Republican",
    D = "Democrat"
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = "Party Composition by Chamber")
```

senators <- people |>
  filter(role == "Sen") |>
  left_join(sponsor_counts, by = "people_id") |>
